    <h4 class="text-primary fw-bold">How to open a Forex Trading Account</h4>
    <div class="col justify-content-start text-left">
        <p>
            <a href="https://icmarkets.com/?camp=59409" id="referalLink" target="_blank" class="fw-bold">IC Market</a> is the broker we recommend, they have a good track records. So you will be opening your account with them. Opening any forex account usually has three steps: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="text-primary fw-bold">Selecting an account type</li>
            Account types vary for different brokers, the details of any account type you want to choose is made available to you on your brokers website.
            <li class="text-primary fw-bold">Registration</li>
            This stage is just about filling in your informations such as names, email, ....etc
            <li class="text-primary fw-bold">Activating your account</li>
            We recommend that you activate your account before depositing. <strong class="text-danger">very important !!!</strong>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <h5 class="text-primary fw-bold">Demo Trading</h5>
            There are two types of trading,
            <ul>
                <li class="text-primary fw-bold">Demo Trading</li>
                This is trading you do without risking/putting/depositing your real money into your forex account. This is where a lot of practice of your strategy has to be done 
                before moving into real trading. You don't just move into real trading just because you have practice for a longer time, you can move into real trading only after you have practiced, 
                perfected (not neccesarily 100% but at least more than 70%, there is no 100%, there is no holy grail) your strategy and you must see for yourself that your profitability in real trading is guaranteed.
                <li class="text-primary fw-bold">Real Trading</li>
                This is trading whereby you are risking/putting/depositing your real money into your forex account. In this phase, you have two major problem to overcome: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li class="text-primary fw-bold">Fear</li>
                    Fear of "What if I lose this trade after placing it". But you still have to take the risk but with intelligent analysis, <span class="text-success fw-bold">Risk takers are money makers</span>.
                    <li class="text-primary fw-bold">Greed</li>
                    This is the most dangerous and major problem of every forex traders, we want to make as much as possible. Some are even seeing Forex as a get-rich-quick-scheme, spit it out immediately if that is what is on your mind. <br>
                    You cannot have $50 and expect to make $100 in a day, it is not wise. <span class="text-danger fw-bold">Greed</span> is the answer to why most traders lose in Fx trading. Another reason why most traders lose is <span class="text-danger fw-bold">Lack of proper analysis or taking fake/incompetent signals from signals group</span>.
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </p>
