            This analysis involves studying economic data reports and news headlines. 
            Fundamental analysis is a way of looking at the forex market by analyzing economic, social, and political forces that may affect currency prices.

            This analysis is used to gauge how other traders feel, whether itâ€™s about the overall currency market or about a particular currency pair. 
            <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm" target="_blank">CFTC</a> website that contains the data report (called Commitments of Traders, COT) for sentimental analysis, it is usually reported on Wednessday but made available to the public on Friday. 
            Market sentiment analysis determines whether the market is bullish or bearish on the current or future fundamental outlook.

            <h5>The Balance to the three analysis</h5>
            Fundamental factors shape sentiment, while technical analysis helps us visualize that sentiment and apply a framework to create our trade plans.
